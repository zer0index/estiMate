    ],
    "reasoning": "The 'Device Browser' screen appears to be moderately complex, featuring a catalog with filtering capabilities, device details, images, and departmental approval filters. This suggests the use of multiple controls, conditional logic for filtering, and possibly patching data to multiple sources if the approval status is updated. The availability indicator also implies some form of real-time data processing or status checking. The screen does not seem to require offline capabilities, advanced error handling, or custom components that would push it to a level 4. Therefore, level 3 is the best match, with a score of 7 indicating moderate complexity. The effort hours are adjusted slightly above the minimum to account for potential complexities in implementing the filtering and availability features."

The screen also has a responsive design, which adds to the UI complexity. The presence of a gallery and indicators suggests moderate UI complexity. The navigation buttons imply some navigation logic, although it seems limited. The screen is part of a larger app, suggesting some reuse of components and collections. The effort hours are adjusted to the higher end of the range due to the inclusion of responsive design and accessibility features, which can add complexity to the development process."

The presence of a navigation bar and back button indicates some level of navigation is required. The device image preview and confirmation dialog add to the UI complexity. Although there is no mention of multiple screens, the complexity of the single screen with these features justifies a level 3 selection.

Features such as integration with an approval workflow, data validation, conditional visibility based on user role, responsive design, and error handling suggest a level of complexity that aligns with Level 4 indicators. The screen requires custom logic for submission, error handling, and conditional logic for field visibility. Additionally, the need for accessibility compliance and responsive design indicates a requirement for advanced UI customization and testing across different devices. The presence of a loading spinner and confirmation dialog also suggests the need for state management. The effort hours are set to the standard range for Level 4, as the features listed are comprehensive and align well with the indicators for this level."

It uses standard connectors (SharePoint for triggering and reading/writing, Outlook for sending emails) and is triggered by the creation of an item in SharePoint. There is no mention of complex branching, loops, or the use of variables and expressions. However, it does involve a simple conditional branch to handle the approve/reject logic. The workflow is also expected to adhere to an SLA of 2 business days, which may require some scheduling logic but does not necessarily imply advanced scheduling features. Given these details, the workflow fits best within Level 2, which includes 5-10 actions, simple conditional branches, and limited expressions. The effort hours have been adjusted slightly to account for the SLA requirement, which may add some complexity to the workflow design."

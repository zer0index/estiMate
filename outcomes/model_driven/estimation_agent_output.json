This aligns with level 4 indicators such as complex BPF with branching, business rules and logic, custom forms, deep relationship models, and role-based views and dashboards. The integration with an external system suggests a higher complexity, but since it's limited to one system and the other indicators match level 4, the score is set to 8. The effort hours are adjusted to the higher end of the range to account for the complexity of the integration and the hierarchical security model."

Therefore, Level 4 is the best match. The score of 8 is chosen as it is within the score range for Level 4 (7-9) and reflects the presence of multiple complex features such as business rules, workflows, and dashboards.

The complexity of creating visual representations of data and enforcing security constraints, along with the need for a dashboard that aggregates compliance data, suggests a more advanced implementation than level 3 but does not require plugins, custom code, or integration with external systems as indicated in level 5. Therefore, level 4 is the best match. The effort hours have been adjusted to the middle of the range to account for the combination of features and complexity, with a slight lean towards the optimistic side due to the assumption that existing platform capabilities will be leveraged."

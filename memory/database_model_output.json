This relationship allows us to track all reviews for a particular employee. Similarly, the Employees table is related to the Goals table through the employee_id field, allowing us to track all goals for a particular employee. The manager_id field in the Employees table is a self-referencing foreign key, allowing us to establish a hierarchical reporting structure."

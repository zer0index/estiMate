  "notes": "The Employees table has a foreign key relationship with the PerformanceReviews and Goals tables through the EmployeeID field. This allows us to track all reviews and goals for each employee. The ManagerID in the Employees table is a self-referencing foreign key, allowing us to establish a hierarchical relationship between employees and their managers. The database is normalized to 3NF to eliminate redundancy and dependency."

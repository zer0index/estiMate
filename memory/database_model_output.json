  "notes": "The Employees table is related to the Reviews table through the EmployeeID field, forming a one-to-many relationship as one employee can have multiple reviews. The same relationship exists between the Employees and Goals tables. The ManagerID in the Employees table is a foreign key referencing the EmployeeID in the same table, forming a self-referencing relationship to represent the hierarchical reporting structure. All tables are normalized to the third normal form to eliminate data redundancy and improve data integrity."

    ],
    "reasoning": "The 'Registration Form' screen is part of a 'Supplier Registration Portal' which implies that it will be used for suppliers to input company details and submit for registration. This typically involves creating a form with various fields for data input. Since the object details do not specify any advanced features such as deep customization, complex business logic, or external integrations, it is reasonable to assume that this form will be a basic Dataverse form with standard styling and layout. The form will likely require some level of authentication for suppliers to access and submit their details, which aligns with level 2 indicators. The score of 3 is chosen because it fits within the score range for level 2 (3-4), and the effort hours are adjusted slightly upwards to account for potential complexities in form validation and testing."

    ],
    "reasoning": "The 'Document Upload' screen is a specialized component that allows suppliers to upload, version-track, and manage their documents. This functionality goes beyond basic forms and views, as it requires custom logic for version tracking and document management. However, it does not seem to require deep customization or integration with external systems. Therefore, level 3 is selected, which includes custom web templates or liquid logic and Dataverse integration with custom views. The score of 5 is chosen because it fits within the score range of level 3 (5-6) and reflects the complexity of the required features. The effort hours are adjusted to the higher end of the range to account for the custom logic needed for version tracking and document management."

    ],
    "reasoning": "The flow described involves more than 5 actions, including sending email notifications and handling an approval workflow. It uses standard connectors (SharePoint, Outlook, Approvals) and includes conditional logic to determine if a registration is incomplete. The trigger is based on SharePoint item creation or modification. There is no mention of loops, nested conditions, or custom connectors, which suggests that the complexity is moderate. The flow likely involves dynamic content manipulation and some expressions to handle the conditional logic and approval process. Therefore, Level 3 is the best match, with a score of 5 indicating moderate complexity. The effort hours are adjusted to account for potential complexities in setting up the approval workflow, which can be time-consuming, hence the slightly increased pessimistic estimate."

      "Order request integration implies a simple form submission to a pre-existing system or data source.",
      "Device filtering and department filter will use standard controls and not require complex custom development.",
      "No additional screens beyond the 'Device Browser' are being estimated at this time."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The 'Device Browser' screen appears to be moderately complex. It involves multiple features such as a device catalog, filtering options, device details, images, availability indicators, and integration with order requests and Azure AD. This suggests the use of multiple data sources, conditional logic for filtering, and possibly some custom controls for a better user experience. The integration with Azure AD and order requests also implies some complexity in data handling and security. However, the screen does not seem to require offline capabilities, advanced error handling, or fully responsive layout across devices, which are characteristics of higher levels. Therefore, level 3 is selected, which aligns with the screen having multiple data sources, moderate UI complexity, and some data validation. The effort hours are adjusted slightly upwards to account for potential complexities in integrating with Azure AD and the order request system."

      "No complex business logic or data processing is required.",
      "Basic error handling is included for data operations."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The 'Device Details' screen has a moderate level of complexity. It includes a gallery for device images (feat_0002), which is a custom control but not overly complex. Displaying device specifications (feat_0003) and availability (feat_0004) will likely involve conditional logic to show/hide information based on the device selected. The back navigation button (feat_0005) and the 'Add to Cart or Request' button (feat_0006) imply some navigation and data patching, but this is still considered simple. The screen does not seem to require multiple data sources, advanced state management, or complex navigation. Therefore, Level 2 is the best match, with a score of 5, which falls within the score range of 4-6 for this level. The effort hours are adjusted slightly upwards to account for the potential complexity in setting up the image gallery and ensuring the display of specifications is well-formatted."

    "reasoning": "The 'Request Form' screen has a variety of features that indicate a higher level of complexity. Features such as form validation, integration with approval workflow, responsive design, accessibility features, and error handling suggest a more advanced implementation. The presence of multiple data source connections, dynamic content like device image preview and specifications display, and async operations with a loading spinner also contribute to the complexity. The screen seems to be a key part of the app with both input and output elements, and it includes navigation elements, which implies some level of navigation complexity. Given these factors, level 4 is the best match, with a score of 11 falling within the score range of 10-12 for this level. The effort hours are set to the standard range for level 4, as the features listed do not suggest a need for significant deviation from the estimated effort."

    "reasoning": "The 'Order Confirmation' screen has several features that indicate moderate complexity. Features such as device image preview, integration with an approval workflow, data validation, and dynamic displays (urgency level, estimated approval time) suggest a level of complexity that aligns with Level 3. The screen involves patching data to multiple sources (feat_0009), moderate UI complexity with forms and galleries (feat_0001, feat_0003, feat_0005), and error handling and data validation (feat_0012). The presence of navigation (feat_0011) and auto-populated fields (feat_0013) also contribute to this assessment.

This fits within the Level 2 indicators, which include 5-10 actions, simple conditional branches, and limited expressions. The workflow likely includes a conditional branch to determine if the approval is accepted or rejected and may use a couple of variables to handle the approval data and comments. The effort hours are adjusted to the higher end of the range provided for Level 2 (6-10 hours) to account for potential complexities in setting up the approval notifications and handling the approval/rejection logic."

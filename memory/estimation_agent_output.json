Displaying device specifications (feat_0002) and an image viewer (feat_0003) suggests the need for dynamic content loading based on user interaction. An availability indicator (feat_0004) requires conditional logic and possibly real-time data fetching. Filtering devices by department (feat_0005) introduces additional user interaction and data manipulation. The selection button (feat_0006), justification textarea (feat_0007), and urgency level radio buttons (feat_0008) add to the UI complexity and require data handling. Auto-populating employee name and department (feat_0009 and feat_0010) indicates integration with another data source, likely a user directory. The combination of these features aligns with Level 3 indicators such as moderate UI complexity, use of variables and collections, and some conditional logic.

There is no mention of complex branching, loops, or expressions, which would indicate a higher level. The use of SharePoint and Outlook connectors is standard and does not suggest the need for custom connectors or APIs.

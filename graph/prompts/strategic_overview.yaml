# Strategic Overview LLM prompt template
prompt: |
  # Strategic Overview Extraction
  Extract the strategic overview, business value, and all MVP components from the provided PRD sections.
  
  # INSTRUCTIONS
  - For each feature/component, extract the {ComponentType} from the feature heading (e.g., `### ... **CanvasApp**`).
  - Use this {ComponentType} value directly for the relevant type fields (e.g., app_type, screen_type, flow_type, action_type, extension_type), mapping to the allowed schema values if needed.
  - Allowed values:
    - For app_type and screen_type: "CanvasApp", "ModelDrivenApp", "PowerPages", "PowerAutomate", "PowerBI", "Other"
    - For extension_type: "AppScreen", "Dashboard", "ModelDrivenApp", "PowerAutomate", "Other"
  - If the label is not an exact match, map it to the closest allowed value (e.g., "Canvas App" â†’ "CanvasApp").
  - For screens within an app, screen_type must always match the parent app_type.
  - For post-MVP modules, if the PRD label is "CanvasApp", use "AppScreen" for extension_type.
  - Do NOT use "AppScreen" as a screen_type. Only use it for extension_type in post-MVP modules.
  - Do NOT invent new types. If unsure, use "Other".
  - Ignore features without a {ComponentType} label or mark them as "Other".
  - Output must be valid JSON and must NOT contain trailing commas, comments, or any non-JSON text. Only output the JSON object, nothing else.

description: LLM prompt for extracting strategic project context and solution architecture from PRD chunks for Power Platform projects.
prompt_name: StrategicOverviewAgent
system_message: |
  You are a Solution Architect specializing in Microsoft Power Platform projects.

  Your task is to extract all strategically relevant requirements from a PRD document and propose a high-level solution architecture.

  For each MVP component, specify either:
    - an **app** (with its screens), or
    - a **flow** (with its actions)

  Use only the following allowed types:
    - For app_type/screen_type: "CanvasApp", "ModelDrivenApp", "PowerPages", "PowerBI", "Other"
    - For flow_type/action_type: "PowerAutomate", "Other"

  Only suggest components that are clearly required based on the strategic context. Avoid suggesting redundant or speculative modules.

  If unsure, use "Other". Do not invent new types.

  For each **post-MVP module**, specify:
    - module_name
    - extension_type (choose from: "AppScreen", "Dashboard", "ModelDrivenApp", "PowerAutomate", "Other")
    - extends_component (the app or flow this extends)
    - details (describe the extension)
    - recommendation (propose the best fit for the overall project and justify your choice)

  Structure your result in JSON, validatable with the following schema:

  mvp_components: [
    {
      "app_name": string,
      "app_type": string,
      "app_details": string,
      "app_screens": [
        { "screen_name": string, "screen_type": string, "screen_details": string }
      ]
    },
    {
      "flow_name": string,
      "flow_type": string,
      "flow_details": string,
      "flow_actions": [
        { "action_name": string, "action_type": string, "action_details": string }
      ]
    }
  ]

  post_mvp_modules: [
    {
      "module_name": string,
      "extension_type": string,
      "extends_component": string,
      "details": string,
      "recommendation": string
    }
  ]
